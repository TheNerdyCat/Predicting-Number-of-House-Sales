# Predict-Number-of-House-Sales

In this project I attempt to predict the number of residential transactions in England and Wales, using a random forest regressor and a k-Nearest Neighbour regressor.

I get a satisfying coefficient of determination of 0.95 using the random forest regressor on the test data, and a slightly substandard r-square of 0.90 using the k-Nearest Neighbour regressor.

Data are available for public use at [Land Registry](http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ppd/), I do not claim ownership over these data.

Any comments, let me know!
